        Building Web Apis

            <h4>Things I did this week:</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Created variables eAffidavit website templates to be used for the eAffidavit website
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    Transcripted already defined variables of each affidavit templates into building payloads in json format of key value-pairs in other to generate the APIs for eAffidavit platforms
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    Created more templates and Fine-tuning existing ones already defined in other to accommodate new variables, while also reconstructing a few of the pre-existing ones in other to aid better understanding by the Client

                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    Built one of the pre-existing Gavel Newsletter into a web landing page using Bootstrap and html for better representation and versatility
                </li>
            </ol>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Amongst the things I intend achieving at Gavel is to make sure I become very profficient with using react and tailwindcss
                </li>
                <br>

                <li>
                    Another thing is using straight away using google to troubleshoot my development problems instead of following watching videos or reading books 
                </li>
            </ul>
            </ul>
        </div>
