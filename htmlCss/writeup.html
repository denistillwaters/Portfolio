            <h5>Todo: </h5>
            <ol>
                <li>Master deleting to the Register ("add to copy) and ("ap to paste)</li>
                <li>Master going back to (0)</li>

            </ol>
            <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Master deleting to the 'register'</span> = Everytime you are using 'dd' always remember to del/yank/copy to the a specific register - this is so that you can retrieve whatever you've copied later. Just "dding" fail at everytime - cause along the line you may have deleted another thing after you deleted the very thing you wanted to paste as such its very important to copy this to the register and try to paste later referencing where you've copied it</p>
            <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Master using '0'</span> = Its very important to use "HOME" (use Esc-0) to rebound and to use "UP"(use Esc-o) goto the first letter on the row. Some of these quirks is what doesnt make people  to want to be using the vim-key bindings. Using the '0' command is very important when one wants to visual select- This is so especially when you when you want to YANK, DEL, CUT AND PASTE - Hence, its very important to make '0' a muscle memory by practising often. Anything that may have to do with visually selecting should be done using '0' - followed by ALWAYS navigating to the very first line before pressing the 'v' - for selecting to the end before 'dd' - if you utilize any other ways aside of these it will mis-align your text. Moreso, making sure that one practise this often. Infact, anything that may have to do with the start of the sentence '0' should be used in line with 'w'</p>
            <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Master using 'Esc'</span> = You have so mastered using 'Esc' as you've mastered using Cntrl+[ that you love how so smoothe it was that any other style you are using seems unatural. Though using this style may be one of the very best at being very fast but it may not  be present in every editor.Maybe I should just go back at using that - it may be it will be what will make me to be faster. May be I should in somedays try and se which one makes me to be faster - if its  using direct 'Esc-key' or by using the 'Cntrl-['. The only issue I have with using the 'Cntrl [' is that when used at the 'cmd' it serves the purpose of 'Cntrl c'. What makes Cntrl_[ more effective is that you do everything from the home(middle) keys but in the case of the 'Esc' you have to stretch-out in other to achieve thesame things  </p>
            <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Scroll with k and J</span> = Another thing is to stop pressing your 'k's and 'j's at interval. You need to master how to just press it down till you get to where you intend to get to - this is very important - this is one thing that every "vim-master" has mastered - scrolling with 'j' and 'k' up and down the page </p>
